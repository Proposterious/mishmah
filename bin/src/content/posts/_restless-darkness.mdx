# Book Details

## A Glimpse of the "Old" Black West


<blockquote>
In 1868, Brackettville, Texas, was a wild and dangerous place for most men. A haven for many undesirables, the town drew all manner of drifters, lowlife, and gunmen from every corner of the surrounding territories. Brackettville was wild and dangerous for most men, but for a Black man, this place was the doorway to Hell. Johnson Able had drifted into Texas two years earlier. A runaway slave from Alabama, Johnson had taken flight one moonless night to escape the Pope Plantation and pursue his own destiny. Rejected and scorned by society, he headed West—but his quest for a new life presented trials and tribulations he’d never imagined. An elegant and powerful novel, Ride Beyond the Restless Darkness explores the role African Americans played in westward expansion and the settlement of the West. It also tells the story of one man’s determination to survive in a hostile land…with his pioneer spirit and values intact and his heart open to possibility.
