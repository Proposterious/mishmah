# Book Details

## Tears: Condensation of the Heart's Vibrations

<blockquote>
"Tears are golden beams of liquid sunshine, flowing from within our heart and soul, and they speak to us with crystal clarity, revealing that within us lies hidden treasure. Whether of unbearable grief, sorrow, joy, humor, or uncontrollable laughter, every tear is a harbinger of ineffable, untold love. It is this love that makes us aware of who we truly are and sensitizes us, enabling us to empathize and anticipate the needs of others. Tears, therefore, are reflections—reminders to love one another, for we travel this human journey down the path to love in the image of one another. The Philosopher’s Tears Annotated Reflections: Volume II is a collection of poems and poetic writing of an autobiographical nature. Each selection serves as a rubric to the reader in garnering the essence of love relationships. Through the “teary eyes” of poetic imagery, the reader is encouraged, motivated, and inspired to look within, and to reexamine the life one is truly living."
